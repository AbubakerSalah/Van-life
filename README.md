# Van-Life 🚐

Van-Life is a frontend project I built with **React** and **JavaScript**.  
The main goal was to practice **routing with React Router** and working with data from a **mock API**.  

It’s a routing-heavy app, with different pages for listings and details, and I tried to make the navigation feel smooth and realistic.  
Even though it’s powered by mock data, the idea was to get as close as possible to how a real-world project would be structured.

## ✨ What it does
- Uses **React Router** for nested and dynamic routes.
- Fetches and displays data from a mock API.
- Responsive design so it works nicely on both desktop and mobile.
- Component-based structure to keep the code clean and reusable.
